Implementation of GHS Algorithm to find Minimum Spanning Tree in a desired Graph
Distributed Algorithm
each node knows only the weights of its adjacent edges.
channels are bidirectional and all messages arrive after a finite specified delay.
The nodes will eventully output the edges that build up the MST.
